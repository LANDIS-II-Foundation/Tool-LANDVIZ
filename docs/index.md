# What is LandViz?

LandViz is a visualization tool that allows researchers or managers to quickly and easily view LANDIS-II outputs. This visualization tool is an easy-to-use software that allows researchers, managers or non-modelers to conduct visual comparisons of model output.  The user activates a website link (generated by the modeler, see below) to use the Viz Tool.  The tool allows the user to select the attributes of interest and to display them.  Multiple attributes (or scenarios) can be displayed in tiled windows that have synchronized pan, zoom and animation of time series.  This is particularly useful for viewing multiple maps at one time and synchronizing their scale and colors.  The tool can also be used to create charts to assess the temporal trends.  With only two clicks, any parameter of interest can be viewed over time as a simple graph.

Prior to using the Viz Tool, the modeler runs LANDIS-II (or any model that provides compatible data) to generate text or raster outputs.  Then the modeler runs a pre-processing tool (PreProc Tool) that automatically sets tool defaults (e.g. projection, landscape extent, resolution, etc.) and creates a link (i.e. website) for the Viz Tool.

This visualization tool was developed with colleagues Johannes Liem and Helen Jenny at Oregon State University.
